# Voting-System-Java

 Three students A, B and C of B.Tech- II year contest for the PR election. With the total
strength of 240 students in II year, simulate the vote casting by generating 240 random numbers
(1 for student A, 2 for B and 3 for C) and store them in an array. Create four threads to equally
share the task of counting the number of votes cast for all the three candidates. Use synchronized
method or synchronized block to update the three count variables. The main thread should
receive the final vote count for all three contestants and hence decide the PR based on the values
received
